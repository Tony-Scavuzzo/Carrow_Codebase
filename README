1) Introduction
	Welcome to the Carrow Lab codebase!
	This codebase contains bash and python scripts for automating computational chemistry research.
	It also contains several files containing the Orca settings for default levels of theory in the Carrow Lab.

	For the codebase help manual, use 'carrow_help'.
	For help with a given command, pass 'help' as an argument.

2) Installation
	For this codebase to work properly, install it in any desired directory.
	Ensure that all commands are configured as executables using 'chmod +x'.
	e.g. chmod +x launch_orca_4
	Then, create/update the CARROW_CODEBASE, USER_EMAIL, and PATH variables with the following commands:

	```
	CARROW_CODEBASE="/project/carrow/codebase"
	export CARROW_CODEBASE

	USER_EMAIL="user@email.com"
	export USER_EMAIL
	
	PATH="$CARROW_CODEBASE:$PATH"
	export PATH
	```

	This can be best accomplished in the user's .bashrc file.
	For an example of how this can be done (as well as other suggested edits), see example_bashrc.

3) Maintenance
	I (ARS) have decided getting the Carrow lab on Github is unrealistic. As such, these are the standards for code maintenance:
	
	i)   Each script contains a string dedicated to version control.
	     As this codebase is curated, authors should document their changes.

	ii)  All python codes are saved in python_scripts/.
	     When editing existing code, always start by copying the existing code to a new version number
             e.g. cp launch_orca_4_v2_1 launch_orca_4_v2_2.py
	     Make all edits to the new version

	iii) All shell scripts have a default script (e.g. launch_orca_4) and a test script (e.g. test_launch_orca_4).
	     When testing new python codes or new shell scripts, always edit the test script, not the default.
	     
	iv)  Only after code has been extensively tested can the default code be updated.
	     At this point, move the existing default code to legacy_shells/ 
	     e.g. mv launch_orca_4 legacy_shells/launch_orca_4_v1_2
	     Make sure to use chmod -x to remove executable permissions from legacy shell scripts
	     e.g. chmod -x launch_orca_4_v1_2
	     Then, rename the test shell to the default shell
	     e.g. mv test_launch_orca_4 launch_orca_4
	     Lastly, copy the new default shell to a test shell
	     e.g. cp launch_orca_4 test_launch_orca_4

	Remember: Other people rely on a working, well documented codebase!
	Not following these steps could result in serious productivity problems in the Carrow lab!
